(*
 * It's (something like) the Free Monad + Interpreter pattern.
 * http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/242795/what-is-the-free-monad-interpreter-pattern
 *
 * Strap in for a mega-comment.
 * (I'd recommend reading both this and the Q&A above;
 * reading multiple explanations of the same thing is usually helpful.)
 *
 *
 * We want to structurally enforce some separation between the business logic
 * of doing things to entities in a database and the operational code
 * concerned with the ins-and-outs of talking to the DB.
 * You can use a repository to do this, but that makes batching up database operations difficult:
 * you have to maintain a list of changes to your objects and make sure you flush them when your
 * transaction is over. It's even harder to batch up **loading** of multiple entities -
 * caching can help a bit here but in the worst case you end up making repeated
 * trips to the database to load data when you traverse relationships between entities.
 * These are (some of) the reasons NHibernate is so complicated.
 *
 *
 * Here's an alternative design with a much more functional flavour.
 * Instead of imperatively accessing the database and attempting to optimise things post hoc,
 * we're going to model a transaction script in-memory as a syntax tree.
 * We are then free to interpret that syntax tree however we like by writing a function
 * which recursively traverses the tree using pattern matching and performing a given action.
 * For example, we could evaluate a query against Elastic Search, or compile it to SQL,
 * or run it against an in-memory dictionary (for testing),
 * or print a string representation of it to the console, or...
 *
 *
 * How do we model such a syntax tree? Fundamentally, a transaction script is a
 * **sequence of database requests** to load and save entities.
 *   1. When you're saving an entity, you supply an instance of the entity to save,
 *      and you also supply the next request in the sequence:
 *
 *          Save of Entity * Request<'a>
 *
 *   2. When you're loading an entity, you give an ID to load and the next request
 *      in the sequence, to run after the entity has been loaded.
 *      But the next request in the sequence may depend upon the object that was loaded.
 *      (For example, we might want to load the identity associated with a member.)
 *      So a 'load' request is modelled as an ID with a continuation function to
 *      execute after the entity has been loaded.
 *
 *          Load of Id * (Entity -> Request<'a>)
 *
 *   3. When you've finished talking to the database, you're allowed to
 *      return a value of your choice.
 *      (For example, you might want to return the Member that you just loaded,
 *      or the count of entities that you modified, or whatever.)
 *
 *          Return of 'a
 *
 * This reasoning has led us to a datatype for requests which looks like this.
 *
 *     type Request<'a> = Save of Entity * Request<'a>
 *                      | Load of Id * (Entity -> Request<'a>)
 *                      | Return of 'a
 *
 * A request is a sequence of Load and Save actions; each particular action
 * may depend on the result of actions before it (because of the function inside Load).
 * Requests are always terminated by Return, which is meant to model "wrapping up a value"
 * into the Request type (without executing any actual real-world database requests.)
 *
 * You'll notice that this isn't _exactly_ the same type as what we have below.
 * Firstly, you'll see that Request has two more type parameters, 'State1 and 'State2.
 * This is because there are two types of entity in our system.
 * As a result, there are actually *two* copies of the Load and Save constructors
 * (LoadState1 and LoadState2).
 * Also, it turned out to be much simpler to put IDs separately in the Save request
 * (even though theoretically you could get it from the entity.)
 *
 *
 * At this point, a database request looks kinda Lisp-y:
 *
 *     // update the name of the Identity associated with Member 123
 *     let myRequest = LoadState1 (123, (fun x ->
 *                       LoadState2 (x.IdentityId, (fun y ->
 *                         SaveState2 (y.Id, { y with Name = x.Name },
 *                           Return ()
 *                         )
 *                       ))
 *                     ))
 *
 *
 * The main thing that's missing is a way to sequence actions.
 * Every request is terminated by Return, and there's no way to join
 * two requests together into a larger request.
 * That's accomplished by the Bind() method on ProjectionBuilder below:
 * Bind takes a Request<'a> and a function (f : 'a -> Request<'b>)
 * and joins up the two requests.
 * It does this by recursively walking down the sequence of requests
 * until it finds a Return. Then it pops the Return off the end of the first
 * request and tacks on the result of the function f instead.
 *
 * So now we can write atomic requests and join them together using Bind.
 * For example, loadState1 loads the entity with the given ID and then
 * immediately returns it, terminating the request.
 * Re-writing the above example, note that the explicit call to
 * Return is no longer necessary, and we have replaced constructor calls with Bind().
 *
 *     let loadState1 id = LoadState1 (id, Return)
 *     let loadState2 id = LoadState2 (id, Return)
 *     let saveState1 id a = SaveState1 (id, a, Return(()))
 *     let saveState2 id m = SaveState2 (id, m, Return(()))
 *
 *     let myRequest = Bind(loadState1 123, fun x ->
 *                       Bind(loadState2 x.IdentityId, fun y ->
 *                         saveState2 y.Id { y with Name = x.Name }
 *                       )
 *                     )
 *
 * Here is the last piece of the puzzle.
 * Bind() lets us sequence requests, but it has a little bit of extra magic built in.
 * Defining a type with a method called Bind() enables F#'s Computation Expression syntax.
 * Computation Expressions are syntactic sugar for calls to Bind() which makes
 * functional programs look imperative. We can rewrite the above program using
 * computation expressions and suddenly it doesn't look like Lisp any more.
 *
 *     let myRequest = project {
 *         let! x = loadState1 123
 *         let! y = loadState2 x.IdentityId
 *         do! saveState2 y.Id { y with Name = x.Name }
 *     }
 *
 *
 * As I said, it looks like an imperative program but all it really does is build an expression tree.
 * To prove this to you, here's a dumb example of a way to process an expression tree by pattern matching.
 * All this function does is return the name of the first request in the sequence.
 * 
 *     let firstRequest req = match req with
 *                                  | LoadState1 _ -> "LoadState1"
 *                                  | LoadState2 _ -> "LoadState2"
 *                                  | SaveState1 _ -> "SaveState1"
 *                                  | SaveState2 _ -> "SaveState2"
 *                                  | Return _ -> "Return"
 *
 * In this solution we leverage the "just data"-nature of a Request
 * to attempt to optimise the number of requests we make.
 * We do an initial traversal of the tree to determine which IDs we need to load from Elastic Search,
 * load them all, and then run the request against the data in memory before flushing everything.
